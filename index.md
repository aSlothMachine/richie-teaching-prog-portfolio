# Welcome to my Online Teaching Programming Portfolio

My name is Richie and I am a CS major who transferred to UCSD in Fall 2020 from a local college. My undergrduate work at UCSD has made me become familiar with SQL, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, SystemVerilog, Python (including Pandas), and C++.

I will utilize this portfolio to showcase what I learned in my "Teach Computational Thinking" with available projects. I hope I can utilize what I learned at UCSD to understand what it takes to teach computational thinking.
